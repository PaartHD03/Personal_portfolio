The Sting of Adventure: A Hackathon Journey to Remember

One day, Parth Todankar casually pitched an idea to me: "Let’s go for the Space Apps Challenge Hackathon at MIT Pune, organized by NASA." It sounded exciting—NASA! Space! Glory! How could I say no? What followed was a whirlwind of chaos, uncomfortable benches, and the worst beverage decision of our lives.

The adventure started before we even hit the road. Parth and I were taking a bus to Pune, while Soorya decided to grace the Indian Railways. Our bus, fashionably late, left us loitering at the stop, chatting about life, hackathons, and the mysterious ability of parents to strike up conversations with total strangers.

Sleep that night? Nonexistent. Between last-minute prep and excitement, it felt like the only thing we packed in abundance was exhaustion.

We finally arrived at MIT Pune, greeted by a buzzing crowd of ambitious participants. Teams from South Bombay, Thane, and beyond mingled in the hall, and our six-member squad from RAIT hit the ground running.

The registration process went smoothly, and the kickoff event left us both inspired and terrified of the tasks ahead. Workshops were insightful, brainstorming was heated, and spirits were high… until we realized our accommodation options were nonexistent.

Fully booked lodges? Check. Dubious alternatives? Double check. Solution? College benches. Who needs a mattress when you can have a solid, unforgiving wooden slab? Luxury redefined.


By the second day, the real fun began. Hours of coding and mentorship sessions were punctuated by hunger pangs, leading us to McDonald’s for a morale-boosting burger binge. But our beverage situation? A crisis. No cold drinks in sight. At 11 PM, desperation hit, and we embarked on a quest for liquid refreshment.

After wandering through dimly lit streets, we found a shop that was… open! Triumph turned to despair as we realized their only offering was Sting. The red can of regret stared back at us, but parched and defeated, we bought eight bottles. "We hate this stuff," everyone muttered… until those bottles magically vanished by the next evening. Funny how survival changes your taste buds.


Morning brought a new adventure: snack-hunting. With only two seats on a borrowed scooty, I teamed up with a stranger from DY Patil Pune College. What started as a simple errand turned into an impromptu cross-college alliance. Snacks acquired, bond formed, and calories consumed.

Later that day, I bumped into some friends of my college buddy Harsh. To my shock, they were Harsh’s childhood friends from his village. Cue a quick photo, a WhatsApp message, and Harsh’s hilariously bewildered reaction. Small world, indeed.


The final day was all about adrenaline and caffeine. Presentations loomed, but sleep deprivation was no match for our team’s determination. We powered through, presenting our ideas with the flair of people who had been awake for 72 hours straight. It was chaotic, nerve-wracking, and oddly exhilarating.

On the way back, we made a pit stop for misal pav. Was it gourmet? Absolutely not. Did it hit the spot? Surprisingly, yes. With stomachs half-satisfied, we boarded the bus, where the true highlight awaited: sleep. For the first time in days, I closed my eyes and drifted off into the kind of slumber that only a comfy bus seat can offer.

The Space Apps Challenge wasn’t just a hackathon; it was a chaotic, hilarious, and slightly sleep-deprived adventure. From late-night Sting missions to random scooty collaborations, every moment was a mix of absurdity and brilliance.

Would I do it again? In a heartbeat. Here’s to more hackathons, terrible beverages, and stories worth telling.
